# Edit Plist File plugin
by Haythem OUEDERNI - @haythemOUE

# 1 - Description
A cordova "plugin" that helps you indicate the modifications on the iOS's *-info.plist file.<br/>
So it avoids you to directly edit the *-info.plist file.<br/>
For example it is used to whitelist some schemes for ios9.<br/>
This plugin was initially created to avoid iOS 9 problems that prevent opening other apps from your own app because some used plugins aren't updated to take into consideration the new specification for iOS 9.

# 2 - How to use

1 . Download the plugin
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-edit-plist-file
or 
cordova plugin add  cordova-plugin-edit-plist-file
